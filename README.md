# EnergieEros
Final Project for CS391. Me and one other student are creating a webstore with the intention to sell jewelry for a client.

It is important to note that we worked together on the same account for the entire beginning of the website creation so the commits don't show accurate contributions.

Tested on Google Chrome.
